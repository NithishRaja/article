        "content":"It’s easy to get off track when you don’t have a plan. Without planning what your day will look like, you wake up not knowing what you want to do or accomplish. Successful people spend a little time the night before giving themselves clear goals for the next day. Then they wake up and go down their list. Life doesn’t always work out as planned, but with a plan, you can adjust without losing momentum."

And look how successful he became. There isn’t necessarily a defined length as to how much time you should be reading, but forming a daily reading habit will expand your knowledge and help you on your journey to success."

And they make smart food choices that will give them the energy they need to accomplish everything on their daily to-do list. So, what’s for dinner? Is the gym on your to-do list? Choose wisely."

        "content":"Other people’s journeys to success can be inspiring; you can learn so much—about their mistakes, their victories, what to do, what not to do. But if you start comparing your progress to theirs, instead of using their stories as inspiration, you can feel jealous, stressed, unworthy. Successful people realize their journey is unique and can’t be compared. So don’t get stuck in the comparison trap—stay focused on your why."

Life is short, and there’s no guarantee as to when it will end. Successful people live each day as if it were their last and make the most out of each moment—and so should you. When you look at a big goal, it’s common to get frustrated at the enormity of what you’re trying to accomplish. If you wake up each day determined to spend it forming good habits, you give yourself a better chance at success. So use these five habits as a starting place to build whatever a successful life means to you."
